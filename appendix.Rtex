\chapter{Usability study for the mobile app}

The following list describes improvements that have been introduced after
evaluating the results of the usability study.

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]

  \item Making the form for general survey data more clear by changing defaults
    and hints.

  \item Enhancing usage efficiency in the dialog for person-related properties.

  \item Allowing ``sit down \& place baggage'' in one step.

  \item Making a shortcut for the ``leave'' action available (without extra
    confirmation) to be consistent with other actions.

  \item Implementing undo support for all actions to correct mistakes.

  \item Adding black borders around seats.

  \item Using icons for persons or baggage on seats, in addition to text
    labels.

  \item Shortening the app's title in the menu bar to make more place for menu
    items.

  \item Fixing severe bug on screen rotation (all inputs were lost).

  \item Indicating the current train direction with an arrow icon.

  \item Remembering the current state of the train and hiding ``door release''
    or ``train starts'' actions, respectively.

  \item Showing a hint when actions are pending, \eg when marking the
    investigator or defining a group.

  \item Highlighting the menu icon and title during a pending action, to signal
    the user that the action is not yet finished.

\end{enumerate}

The previous plot show that people most often choose the seat diagonally across
from another person.
However, this preference seems to be less pronounced when they choose a window
seat or a forward-facing seat (which are the most popular seat categories).
Possible hypothesis are:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

  \item If they decide for a window seat they accept a closer position to the
    other passenger more often.
    That is, they give up on distance in favor of a window seat.
    See figure~\ref{fig:seating-data-plot-position-relative-window}.

  \item If they decide for a forward-facing seat they accept a closer position
    to the other passenger more often.
    That is, they give up on distance in favor of a forward-facing seat.
    See figure~\ref{fig:seating-data-plot-position-relative-forward}.

\end{itemize}
